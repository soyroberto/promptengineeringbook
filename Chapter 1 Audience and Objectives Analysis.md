# Chapter 1 Audience and Objectives Analysis

## Target Audience
- Technical readers who need to understand prompt engineering fundamentals
- Non-technical readers who want to effectively communicate with AI systems
- Both audiences need to understand what makes prompts ineffective

## Chapter Objectives
1. Introduce the concept of insufficient prompts through clear examples
2. Demonstrate why vague prompts lead to unpredictable or unsatisfactory results
3. Highlight the importance of context, specificity, and detail in prompt creation
4. Establish Leonardo (formerly Echo) as the guiding mascot for the book
5. Set the foundation for later chapters on effective prompt engineering techniques
6. Create an engaging, accessible entry point for both technical and non-technical readers

## Bad Prompt Examples to Include
1. "Write a story" (primary example)
2. "Give me information"
3. "Help me with my project"
4. "Make this better"
5. "Analyze this data"
6. "Create a marketing plan"
7. "Fix this code"

## Key Points to Emphasize
- AI systems lack context unless explicitly provided
- Ambiguity in prompts leads to ambiguity in responses
- The relationship between prompt quality and response quality
- How AI "fills in the blanks" when information is missing
- The importance of specificity in achieving desired outcomes
- How technical and non-technical users make similar mistakes in prompt creation

## Leonardo's Role
- Leonardo will guide readers through examples, pointing out flaws in prompts
- Leonardo will provide "prompt anatomy" breakdowns showing what's missing
- Leonardo will offer improved versions of each bad prompt
- Leonardo will maintain an approachable, friendly tone while delivering technical insights
