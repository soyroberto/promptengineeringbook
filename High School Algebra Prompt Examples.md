# High School Algebra Prompt Examples

## From Bad to Excellent: Crafting Effective Math Help Prompts

### Introduction to the Example
This section will demonstrate how to craft effective prompts for high school algebra assistance, showing the progression from insufficient to excellent prompts. This example is particularly valuable as mathematics requires precision and clarity, making it an ideal domain to illustrate prompt engineering principles.

### Bad Prompt Example
> **Prompt:** Help me with algebra.

**Leonardo's Prompt Anatomy:**

❌ **No specific problem provided** - What algebra problem needs solving?  
❌ **No grade level or difficulty indicated** - Is this basic or advanced high school algebra?  
❌ **No current understanding described** - What concepts are already understood vs. challenging?  
❌ **No learning goal specified** - Is the goal to solve a specific problem or understand a concept?  
❌ **No format preference mentioned** - How should the solution be presented?  
❌ **No prior attempts shared** - What approaches have already been tried?  

### Progression of Improving Prompts

#### Slightly Better Prompt:
> Help me solve this equation: 2x + 5 = 13

This provides the specific problem but still lacks context about learning goals, difficulty level, and format preferences.

#### Good Prompt:
> I'm a 9th-grade student learning how to solve linear equations. Can you help me solve 2x + 5 = 13 and explain each step of the process? I understand how to add and subtract from both sides but get confused when dealing with coefficients.

This prompt provides:
- Educational context (9th-grade student)
- Specific problem (2x + 5 = 13)
- Request for step-by-step explanation
- Current understanding level (comfortable with adding/subtracting, confused by coefficients)

#### Excellent Prompt:
> I'm a high school algebra teacher creating materials to help students progress from basic to advanced equation solving. Could you please:
> 
> 1. Solve the linear equation 2x + 5 = 13 with a detailed step-by-step explanation suitable for beginners
> 2. Solve the system of equations { 3x + 2y = 7, x - y = 1 } with steps appropriate for intermediate students
> 3. Solve the quadratic equation 2x² - 5x - 3 = 0 using both the quadratic formula and completing the square, explaining when each approach is preferable
> 4. Provide 2-3 practice problems for each difficulty level with answers
> 
> For each solution, please highlight common mistakes students might make and include visual representations where helpful. My goal is to create a comprehensive resource that shows the progression of algebraic concepts.

This excellent prompt provides:
- Clear context (teacher creating educational materials)
- Specific problems at multiple difficulty levels
- Request for different solution methods with comparisons
- Request for practice problems to reinforce learning
- Request for common mistakes to anticipate student difficulties
- Request for visual aids to enhance understanding
- Clear statement of the overall goal

### Leonardo's Analysis

**Leonardo Says:** *"Notice how the excellent algebra prompt doesn't just ask for answers—it provides context about the purpose (creating teaching materials), specifies multiple difficulty levels, requests particular solution methods, and even asks for anticipation of common mistakes. This gives the AI a comprehensive framework to deliver truly useful content rather than just basic solutions. When asking for help with complex topics like mathematics, providing this level of detail ensures you get responses that match your actual educational needs."*

### Why This Example Matters

This algebra example demonstrates several key principles of effective prompt engineering:

1. **Scaffolding complexity** - The excellent prompt builds from basic to advanced problems, allowing for comprehensive coverage
2. **Educational context** - Specifying the learning environment helps tailor explanations to the appropriate level
3. **Metacognitive elements** - Requesting information about common mistakes shows how prompts can address not just content but learning process
4. **Multiple representation requests** - Asking for visual aids demonstrates how prompts can specify format preferences
5. **Purpose clarity** - Stating the goal of creating a comprehensive resource helps align the response with the end use case

For both technical and non-technical readers, this example illustrates how even in domains that seem straightforward (solving math problems), thoughtful prompt engineering can dramatically improve the quality and usefulness of AI assistance.
