# INDEX CARD 3: HOW AI WORKS

![Echo the AI Fox mascot explains AI processes]

## ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: THE PROCESS

AI systems work by processing large amounts of data to identify patterns and make predictions. This process has several key components:

**Data:** AI systems learn from examples—text, images, numbers, or other information that humans have collected and organized. The quality and diversity of this data directly impacts AI performance.

**Training:** During training, AI systems adjust their internal parameters to better recognize patterns in the data. This process is similar to how humans learn from experience, but follows mathematical principles.

**Inference:** Once trained, AI systems can apply what they've learned to new situations, making predictions or generating outputs based on previously unseen inputs.

**Feedback:** Many AI systems improve over time through feedback, either from humans or from measuring their own performance against specific goals.

**Remember:** AI doesn't "think" like humans do—it processes information mathematically to approximate human-like outputs.
