# Leonardo's Context Highlights for Medical Example

## Key Elements Where Leonardo Emphasizes Context in the Medical Example

### Introduction to the Example
The medical research example is positioned as a demonstration of how prompt engineering principles can benefit healthcare professionals who may not be technically savvy with AI systems. This reinforces the chapter's message about the importance of detailed prompts while specifically addressing non-technical professionals.

### Bad Prompt Analysis
Leonardo's Prompt Anatomy breakdown for "Find information about new diabetes treatments" follows the consistent format established in previous examples, highlighting the specific missing elements that make this prompt insufficient:
- No patient context
- No current treatment specified
- No specific research goals
- No timeframe
- No preferred sources
- No format requirements

This systematic breakdown reinforces Leonardo's role as an analytical guide who helps readers identify what's missing in vague prompts, particularly in a professional healthcare context.

### Progression Demonstration
The example shows a clear progression from bad to excellent prompts, which provides healthcare professionals with a practical understanding of how prompts can be iteratively improved. This progression demonstrates:
1. Adding condition specificity and timeframe (slightly better)
2. Adding professional context, patient population, and information needs (good)
3. Adding comprehensive patient details, structured research questions, and format preferences (excellent)

### Leonardo's Analysis Quote
Leonardo's quote effectively ties the medical example to clinical practice: *"Notice how the excellent medical prompt transforms a vague request into a powerful clinical decision support tool. By providing specific patient details, current treatment, and structured research questions, the doctor gives the AI the context needed to deliver truly relevant information. This approach saves valuable clinical time by filtering out irrelevant research and focusing only on studies applicable to the specific patient scenario. For busy healthcare professionals, this kind of prompt engineering isn't just about getting better informationâ€”it's about getting precisely targeted insights that can immediately inform patient care decisions."*

This quote emphasizes:
- The transformation from vague request to decision support tool
- The importance of patient-specific context
- The practical time-saving benefits
- The clinical relevance of targeted information
- The immediate applicability to patient care

### Why This Example Matters Section
The final section explicitly connects the medical example to key benefits for healthcare professionals:
- Time efficiency
- Clinical relevance
- Depth with focus
- Evidence integration
- Practical application

This reinforces Leonardo's educational role by explicitly drawing out the practical benefits for busy healthcare professionals.

## Integration with Overall Chapter
The medical example complements the existing examples by:
1. Adding a healthcare-focused example that addresses non-technical professionals
2. Demonstrating how prompt engineering applies to evidence-based professional practice
3. Showing how domain expertise (medical knowledge) can be leveraged in prompts
4. Illustrating how structured information requests can save time and improve decision-making
5. Providing a real-world example that shows immediate practical benefits beyond just "better information"

Leonardo's presence in this example maintains consistency with the rest of the chapter while specifically addressing the needs of non-technical professionals who work in knowledge-intensive fields.
