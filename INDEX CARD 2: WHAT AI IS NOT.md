# INDEX CARD 2: WHAT AI IS NOT

![Echo the AI Fox mascot dispels AI myths]

## ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS

AI is not sentient or conscious. Despite impressive capabilities, AI systems do not have self-awareness, emotions, desires, or understanding of their own existence.

AI is not a magical solution to all problems. It has specific strengths and limitations, requiring careful implementation and human oversight to be effective.

AI is not capable of true creativity or original thought. While it can combine and transform existing information in novel ways, it cannot generate truly original ideas disconnected from its training data.

AI is not inherently objective or unbiased. AI systems reflect the data they were trained on and the values of their creators, often perpetuating existing biases if not carefully designed.

**Remember:** AI is a reflection of human knowledge and values, not an independent intelligence with its own agenda.
