## The Role of Tokenization in System Architectures

Tokenization, which we explored earlier in this chapter, plays a crucial role in all three architectures:

### Technical Path: Tokenization in the Architecture

1. **Input Processing**
   - All three systems convert user input to tokens
   - Token counting affects pricing and context limits
   - Special tokens mark system messages, tools, etc.

2. **Context Management**
   - Context windows are measured in tokens
   - Systems must manage token usage efficiently
   - Compression techniques help maximize context

3. **Output Generation**
   - Generated text is produced token-by-token
   - Sampling and decoding strategies affect output quality
   - Token probabilities influence response certainty

### Practical Path: How Tokenization Affects Users

Even though tokenization happens behind the scenes, it affects your experience:

- **Context limits**: How much information the system can consider at once
- **Response speed**: How quickly the system generates responses
- **Cost**: How much you pay for API usage (often priced per token)
- **Language support**: How well the system handles different languages
