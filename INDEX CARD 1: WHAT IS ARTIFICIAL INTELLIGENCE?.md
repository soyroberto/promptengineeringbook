## ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: THE BASICS

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science focused on creating systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.

These systems learn from data and experience, improving their performance over time without being explicitly programmed for every situation they encounter.

AI encompasses various approaches including machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and roboticsâ€”all working to simulate aspects of human cognition.

Modern AI excels at pattern recognition, prediction based on historical data, processing and generating language, and optimizing complex systems with many variables.

**Remember:** AI is a tool created by humans to extend human capabilities, not replace them.
