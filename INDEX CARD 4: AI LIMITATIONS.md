## ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: CURRENT LIMITATIONS

Despite impressive capabilities, AI systems have several important limitations:

**Context Understanding:** AI often struggles to understand context, nuance, and implicit information that humans grasp intuitively. It processes information literally rather than understanding deeper meanings.

**Common Sense:** AI lacks the common sense reasoning that humans develop through lived experience. It may miss obvious inconsistencies or make suggestions that don't make practical sense.

**Causality:** AI systems can identify correlations in data but often struggle to understand cause-and-effect relationships. They can tell you what happens together but not necessarily why.

**Adaptability:** While AI can excel in domains it was trained for, it typically cannot adapt to entirely new situations without additional training or human intervention.

**Remember:** The limitations of AI are why prompt engineering is so valuableâ€”it helps bridge the gap between how humans and AI systems understand the world.
