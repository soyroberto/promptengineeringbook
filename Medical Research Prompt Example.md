# Medical Research Prompt Example

## From Vague to Valuable: Crafting Effective Medical Research Prompts

### Introduction to the Example
This section will demonstrate how healthcare professionals, particularly doctors who may not be technically savvy with AI systems, can craft effective prompts for medical research assistance. This example shows how well-designed prompts can enhance clinical practice by adding speed, depth, and insights to medical knowledge acquisition.

### Bad Prompt Example
> **Prompt:** Find information about new diabetes treatments.

**Leonardo's Prompt Anatomy:**

❌ **No patient context provided** - What type of diabetes? What patient demographics?  
❌ **No current treatment specified** - What treatments have already been tried or considered?  
❌ **No specific research goals indicated** - Is this for general knowledge, a specific patient case, or research?  
❌ **No timeframe mentioned** - How recent should the research be?  
❌ **No preferred sources specified** - Are peer-reviewed journals preferred over clinical guidelines?  
❌ **No format requirements** - How should the information be structured for clinical application?  

### Progression of Improving Prompts

#### Slightly Better Prompt:
> Find the latest research on Type 2 diabetes treatments published in the last two years.

This provides the specific condition (Type 2 diabetes) and a timeframe (last two years) but still lacks clinical context and application goals.

#### Good Prompt:
> I'm a primary care physician looking for recent clinical trials on Type 2 diabetes treatments for elderly patients with kidney complications. Please summarize findings from major studies published in the last 3 years, focusing on efficacy and safety profiles.

This prompt provides:
- Professional context (primary care physician)
- Specific condition (Type 2 diabetes)
- Patient population (elderly with kidney complications)
- Timeframe (last 3 years)
- Content focus (clinical trials)
- Information needs (efficacy and safety profiles)

#### Excellent Prompt:
> I'm an endocrinologist treating a 68-year-old female patient with a 15-year history of Type 2 diabetes who has developed stage 2 chronic kidney disease. She's currently on metformin (1000mg daily) and glipizide (10mg daily), but her HbA1c remains at 8.2%. 
> 
> Please provide:
> 
> 1. A summary of clinical research from the past 3 years on treatment adjustments for patients with similar profiles, particularly focusing on GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors
> 
> 2. Key findings regarding medication safety in patients with kidney disease, including specific eGFR thresholds for dosage adjustments or contraindications
> 
> 3. A comparison of outcomes from recent studies examining combination therapies versus single-agent approaches for patients with inadequate glycemic control despite dual oral therapy
> 
> 4. Any recent consensus guidelines (ADA, EASD, KDIGO) updates specifically addressing diabetes management in the context of CKD
> 
> Please format your response with clearly labeled sections, include relevant statistical data where available, and note any conflicting findings or ongoing debates in the literature. I'd appreciate citations to specific studies so I can review them in detail if needed.

This excellent prompt provides:
- Detailed clinical context (endocrinologist with specific patient case)
- Comprehensive patient profile (age, gender, disease duration, comorbidity, current medications, lab values)
- Specific medication classes of interest
- Multiple related research questions structured logically
- Request for safety information relevant to the comorbidity
- Request for comparative effectiveness data
- Request for guideline updates from specific organizations
- Preferred response format with sections
- Request for statistical data and citations
- Acknowledgment of potential conflicts in the literature

### Leonardo's Analysis

**Leonardo Says:** *"Notice how the excellent medical prompt transforms a vague request into a powerful clinical decision support tool. By providing specific patient details, current treatment, and structured research questions, the doctor gives the AI the context needed to deliver truly relevant information. This approach saves valuable clinical time by filtering out irrelevant research and focusing only on studies applicable to the specific patient scenario. For busy healthcare professionals, this kind of prompt engineering isn't just about getting better information—it's about getting precisely targeted insights that can immediately inform patient care decisions."*

### Why This Example Matters

This medical research example demonstrates several key benefits of effective prompt engineering for healthcare professionals:

1. **Time efficiency** - By specifying exactly what information is needed, physicians avoid wading through irrelevant research
2. **Clinical relevance** - Patient-specific prompts ensure the information directly applies to real clinical scenarios
3. **Depth with focus** - Structured requests allow for comprehensive coverage of relevant topics without overwhelming breadth
4. **Evidence integration** - Requests for guideline updates alongside research findings help contextualize new evidence
5. **Practical application** - Format requests ensure information is presented in a way that facilitates clinical decision-making

For non-technical healthcare professionals, this example illustrates how prompt engineering doesn't require technical expertise—it simply requires applying the same clinical specificity they use in medical documentation to their AI interactions. The result is AI assistance that functions more like a knowledgeable colleague than a generic search engine.
