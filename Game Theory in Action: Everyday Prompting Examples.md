# Game Theory in Action: Everyday Prompting Examples

In this section, we bring game theory to life with practical examples showing how regular users can apply these strategic principles to common prompting scenarios. We will demonstrate how shifting from a basic prompt to a game-theoretically informed prompt can dramatically improve the quality, relevance, and usefulness of AI responses.

## Example 1: Brainstorming Blog Post Ideas

**Common Scenario**: A user needs ideas for a blog post about sustainable gardening.

### Before: Basic Prompt

```
Give me some blog post ideas about sustainable gardening.
```

**Typical AI Response**: A generic list of common topics like "Composting 101," "Water-wise Gardening," "Organic Pest Control," etc.

**Game-Theoretic Weakness**: This is a zero-level thinking prompt. It doesn’t establish a cooperative game, provide strategic information, or guide the AI toward the user’s specific (and perhaps unstated) goals.

### After: Game-Theoretically Informed Prompt (Cooperative & Information Revelation Frameworks)

```
I run a blog aimed at urban apartment dwellers who are new to gardening and interested in sustainability. My goal is to provide them with practical, actionable advice they can implement in small spaces with limited resources. I want blog post ideas that are engaging, beginner-friendly, and specifically address the challenges and opportunities of sustainable gardening in an urban apartment setting.

A successful list of ideas would:
1. Be unique and not just generic sustainable gardening topics.
2. Focus on solutions for small spaces (balconies, windowsills).
3. Emphasize low-cost or DIY approaches.
4. Suggest catchy, SEO-friendly titles.

Let's brainstorm 5-7 distinct blog post ideas that fit these criteria. For each idea, please provide a catchy title, a brief 2-3 sentence summary, and 2-3 keywords.
```

**Improved AI Response**: A tailored list of blog post ideas like "Micro-Composting for Your Metropolis Pad: Turning Kitchen Scraps into Balcony Gold," "Vertical Victory Gardens: Sustainable Edibles on Your City Walls," "DIY Seed Starting for Urbanites: From Windowsill to Harvest," etc., each with summaries and keywords as requested.

### Analysis:

**Technical Path: Strategic Improvements**
- **Cooperative Game Setup**: The prompt explicitly states the user’s goal ("provide practical, actionable advice") and target audience, framing the interaction as a collaborative effort to meet these needs.
- **Information Revelation**: The user strategically reveals key information: target audience (urban apartment dwellers, new to gardening), content focus (small spaces, limited resources, beginner-friendly), and desired output format (catchy titles, summaries, keywords).
- **Incentive Alignment**: By defining success criteria ("unique," "small spaces focus," "low-cost," "catchy titles"), the prompt aligns the AI’s generation process with the user’s specific quality metrics. The AI is incentivized to produce ideas that meet these criteria.
- **Mechanism Design**: The prompt acts as a mechanism that channels the AI’s capabilities toward a specific, well-defined output space, reducing ambiguity and improving relevance.

**Practical Path: Why It Works Better**
- **You and AI as Teammates**: The prompt clearly tells the AI who the blog is for and what kind of advice they need. This helps the AI act like a helpful brainstorming partner.
- **Giving the Right Clues**: By explaining the blog’s focus (urban, small spaces, beginners), the user gives the AI the necessary clues to generate relevant, non-generic ideas.
- **Defining a Win**: When the user specifies what makes a good idea (unique, small-space friendly, DIY, catchy titles), the AI knows exactly what to aim for. It’s like giving a teammate a clear target.
- **Clear Instructions**: Asking for a specific number of ideas and a particular format (title, summary, keywords) makes it easier for the AI to deliver exactly what’s needed.

## Example 2: Summarizing a Research Paper

**Common Scenario**: A student needs to quickly understand the main points of a lengthy academic research paper.

### Before: Basic Prompt

```
Summarize this research paper: [Paste paper text or link]
```

**Typical AI Response**: A general summary that might be too long, too short, too technical, or miss the specific aspects the student needs.

**Game-Theoretic Weakness**: This prompt lacks strategic information about the user’s context or purpose for the summary. It doesn’t guide the AI on length, focus, or audience for the summary.

### After: Game-Theoretically Informed Prompt (Information Revelation & Cooperative Frameworks)

```
I am an undergraduate student in environmental science, and I need to summarize the attached research paper on ocean acidification for a class presentation. My presentation focuses on the paper's methodology and key findings, rather than its literature review or future work sections.

Please provide a summary that is:
1. Approximately 300-400 words long.
2. Written in clear, accessible language suitable for an undergraduate audience (avoiding overly technical jargon where possible, or explaining it briefly).
3. Specifically highlights the research methodology used in the paper.
4. Clearly lists the 3-4 most important findings and their significance.
5. Briefly mentions the main limitations acknowledged by the authors.

My goal is to quickly grasp these core aspects to prepare my presentation slides. Please structure the summary with clear headings for "Methodology," "Key Findings," and "Limitations."
```

**Improved AI Response**: A structured summary of the specified length, focusing on methodology, key findings, and limitations, written in accessible language with appropriate headings.

### Analysis:

**Technical Path: Strategic Improvements**
- **Information Revelation (User Context)**: The user reveals their role (undergraduate student), subject (environmental science), and purpose (class presentation), allowing the AI to tailor the summary’s complexity and focus.
- **Cooperative Goal Alignment**: The prompt explicitly states the user’s goal ("quickly grasp these core aspects to prepare my presentation slides"), enabling the AI to optimize the summary for this specific utility.
- **Mechanism Design (Output Specification)**: The prompt specifies length (300-400 words), language style (accessible, jargon explanation), content focus (methodology, findings, limitations), and structure (headings). This mechanism constrains the AI’s output space to align with user needs.
- **Strategic Filtering**: By stating the presentation focuses on methodology and findings, and *not* literature review or future work, the user guides the AI’s attention and resource allocation during summarization, playing a game of information prioritization.

**Practical Path: Why It Works Better**
- **Telling the AI Your Role**: Explaining you’re an undergraduate student helps the AI use language you’ll understand.
- **Sharing Your Purpose**: Knowing the summary is for a class presentation focusing on methodology and findings helps the AI pick out the most relevant information.
- **Setting Clear Expectations**: Asking for a specific length, language style, and sections (Methodology, Key Findings, Limitations) ensures the summary is exactly what you need.
- **Focusing the AI’s Attention**: By saying what *not* to focus on (literature review, future work), you help the AI concentrate on the parts of the paper that matter most to you.

## Example 3: Generating Creative Story Plot Twists

**Common Scenario**: A writer is stuck and needs a surprising plot twist for their mystery novel.

### Before: Basic Prompt

```
Give me a plot twist for my mystery novel.
```

**Typical AI Response**: A generic or clichéd plot twist that may not fit the novel’s existing plot, characters, or tone.

**Game-Theoretic Weakness**: This is a request with extremely high information asymmetry. The AI knows nothing about the novel. The prompt doesn’t set up a cooperative game for co-creation.

### After: Game-Theoretically Informed Prompt (Information Revelation, Cooperative & Multi-Agent Simulation Frameworks)

```
I'm writing a cozy mystery novel set in a small English village. The main character is a retired librarian, Miss Marple-esque, named Elara. The victim is the unpopular village mayor, found dead in his locked study. So far, the main suspects are: his estranged wife, a disgruntled business partner, and a young activist who publicly argued with him.

I need a truly surprising plot twist that subverts common mystery tropes but still feels fair to the reader (i.e., clues could have been there). The tone is light-hearted despite the murder, with witty dialogue.

Let's play a game of co-creation. I want you to act as three different expert mystery authors:
1. **Agatha Christie**: Focus on intricate plotting, misdirection, and a surprise culprit from an unexpected quarter.
2. **Raymond Chandler**: Introduce a darker, more complex motive, perhaps involving a hidden past or systemic corruption, even if it needs to be toned down for a cozy mystery.
3. **A Modern Trope-Subverting Author (like Janice Hallett or Richard Osman)**: Suggest a twist that plays with the genre's conventions or narrative structure itself.

Please have each "author" suggest one distinct plot twist, explaining their reasoning and how it fits the cozy mystery genre while being surprising. Then, as a master editor, briefly evaluate which twist might be most effective for my stated needs and why.
```

**Improved AI Response**: Three distinct plot twists, each in the voice/style of the requested author persona, with rationales. For example, "Agatha Christie" might suggest the narrator (a seemingly minor character) is the killer. "Raymond Chandler" might suggest a long-forgotten crime connects to the mayor. The "Modern Author" might suggest the victim faked his death. The AI, as editor, then provides a comparative analysis.

### Analysis:

**Technical Path: Strategic Improvements**
- **Information Revelation (Contextual Grounding)**: The user provides essential context: genre (cozy mystery), setting (English village), protagonist (retired librarian Elara), victim, and current suspects. This significantly reduces the AI’s uncertainty.
- **Cooperative Game (Co-creation Framing)**: The phrase "Let's play a game of co-creation" explicitly frames the interaction as collaborative, encouraging the AI to be a partner.
- **Multi-Agent Simulation Framework**: Requesting the AI to adopt personas of different authors (Agatha Christie, Raymond Chandler, Modern Author) leverages role theory. This creates a simulated panel of experts, each contributing from a distinct strategic viewpoint (utility function).
- **Mechanism Design (Structured Output)**: The prompt specifies the output structure: each persona suggests one twist with reasoning, followed by an editorial evaluation. This guides the AI to produce a structured, analytical response.
- **Constrained Creativity**: The prompt balances the need for surprise ("truly surprising," "subverts common tropes") with constraints ("still feels fair," "fits cozy mystery genre"), guiding the AI’s creative search within a defined solution space.

**Practical Path: Why It Works Better**
- **Setting the Scene**: Telling the AI about your novel (genre, characters, plot so far) gives it the raw material to work with.
- **Asking for Specific Kinds of Surprises**: Explaining you want a twist that’s surprising but fair, and fits a cozy mystery, helps the AI narrow down the possibilities.
- **Creating a Virtual Brainstorming Team**: Asking the AI to think like different famous mystery authors (Christie, Chandler, etc.) is like having a panel of experts. Each “expert” will come up with a different kind of idea based on their “style.”
- **Getting an Editor’s Opinion**: Asking the AI to then act as an editor helps you see which of the generated ideas might be the best fit for your story.

## Example 4: Debugging Code

**Common Scenario**: A programmer is stuck on a piece of code that isn’t working as expected.

### Before: Basic Prompt

```
My Python code isn't working. Can you help?
[Paste of long, uncommented code snippet]
```

**Typical AI Response**: General debugging advice, or an attempt to fix obvious syntax errors without understanding the code’s purpose or the specific problem.

**Game-Theoretic Weakness**: High information asymmetry. The AI lacks context about the code’s purpose, the expected behavior, the actual behavior, and any error messages. The user isn’t playing a cooperative game to solve the problem.

### After: Game-Theoretically Informed Prompt (Cooperative, Information Revelation & Iterative Frameworks)

```
I'm working on a Python script that's supposed to read a CSV file, process the data, and output a new CSV with an added column. I'm encountering an issue where the output CSV is created, but it's empty except for the headers.

Here's the relevant function where I suspect the problem lies:
```python
# [Paste a FOCUSED, MINIMAL, REPRODUCIBLE code snippet related to the issue]
# Example:
# def process_data(input_file, output_file):
#     df = pd.read_csv(input_file)
#     # ... some processing steps ...
#     df['new_column'] = calculated_values # I think the issue might be here
#     df.to_csv(output_file, index=False)
```

**Expected Behavior**: The `output_file.csv` should contain all original data plus a `new_column` with calculated values.
**Actual Behavior**: `output_file.csv` only contains the header row.
**Error Messages**: None, the script runs to completion.
**What I've Tried**: I've checked that `input_file` exists and has data. I've printed the DataFrame `df` before the `to_csv` call, and it *seems* to have the data and the new column, which is confusing.

Let's work together to debug this. Could you please:
1. Analyze the provided function for potential logical errors that would cause an empty CSV output despite the DataFrame appearing correct before saving?
2. Suggest specific print statements or debugging steps I can add to pinpoint where the data might be getting lost or overwritten?
3. If you spot a likely error, explain the reasoning and suggest a fix.

I'm using Python 3.9 and Pandas 1.3.0.
```

**Improved AI Response**: Specific analysis of the provided code, suggestions for targeted debugging (e.g., checking DataFrame shape right before `to_csv`, verifying `calculated_values`), and potential explanations for the discrepancy (e.g., `df` being a view vs. copy, issues with `to_csv` parameters, or `calculated_values` being empty/None in a way that Pandas handles unexpectedly on write).

### Analysis:

**Technical Path: Strategic Improvements**
- **Cooperative Problem Solving**: The prompt frames the interaction as a collaborative debugging session ("Let's work together to debug this").
- **Information Revelation (Problem Scoping)**: The user provides crucial context: code purpose, expected behavior, actual behavior, error messages (or lack thereof), and troubleshooting steps already taken. This drastically reduces the AI’s search space.
- **Minimal Reproducible Example Principle**: By promising a focused snippet (even if the example here is a placeholder), the user signals an understanding of efficient debugging, a key aspect of information revelation in coding.
- **Iterative Refinement (Implicit)**: The request for debugging steps sets up a potential multi-turn interaction where the user can apply suggestions and report back, fitting an iterative game model.
- **Hypothesis Sharing**: Stating "I think the issue might be here" and "which is confusing" provides the AI with the user’s current mental model and points of uncertainty, allowing for more targeted assistance.
- **Environment Specification**: Providing Python and Pandas versions is crucial information for version-specific bugs or behaviors.

**Practical Path: Why It Works Better**
- **Team Up for Debugging**: Saying
